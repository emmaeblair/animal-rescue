Animis (work in progress)

### Problem Statement:

Animal rescues are often non-profit, with little income to spare. As a result, sophisticated systems that are tailored to their mission are either too expensive or do not exist. This solution aims to combine all aspects of an animal rescue into one system that takes care of the busy work and allows all attention to be focused on saving as many animals as possible.
